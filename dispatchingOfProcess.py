# the main code for dispacthing of process in OS:
# This project is about managing of process in OS. We store the list of proccess with the next attributes:
# id of process
# name of process
# time of execution
# priotiry of process
# state of process By this script we can:
# search of process by PID
# search of process by name Process dispatching have to use stack and queue mechanisms. 
#  FIFO for low priority process. LIFO for low priority process.
# we can change state o processes
# add process
# delete process
# This project has test purpose and is needed for understanding of stack and 
# queue mechanisms, basic principles of OOP and practice of soling real issues.
